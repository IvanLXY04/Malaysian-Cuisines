        <p>One of the best-known eateries in Kampar is Heng Kee, which specializes in chicken rice, cooked in Chinese claypots atop charcoal braziers. Founded sometime around the 1950s by a Cantonese sojourner, Lai Heng, the eatery started off as a road-side stall on wheels. He later settled in a permanent location at Chan Siew Heng Kopitiam, a traditional Chinese coffeeshop in Kampar Old Town in 1960s, before moving to Wing Loke Yuen Coffee Shop on Jalan Idris (the town’s busy restaurant-lined precinct), towards the end of the 60s decade. Now, it’s got its own shophouse on Jalan Idris.
            Heng Kee’s chicken rice is cooked with salted fish, slivers of Chinese sausages, and small pieces of chopped chicken which had been marinated with minced ginger, oyster sauce and light soy sauce. Dark soy sauce is drizzled onto the rice, which is then topped with an egg & chopped scallions before serving.
            The current owner-chef is 59-year-old Lai Lit Keong @ Ah Keong, who had been helping his father, Lai Heng, since he was a kid. Ah Keong now runs the eatery with clockwork efficiency, as he cooked upwards of 14 claypots at one go, effortlessly monitoring the multiple individual pots of chicken rice he had started cooking upon receiving the orders at various times.

        <p>Dim Sum is a term used to describe a collection of snack-sized dishes usually served on small plates and accompanied with tea. Dim sum translates as “A little touch of heart” which is said to describe the food’s pleasant flavours and comforting texture. When referring to Dim Sum, the phrase “yum cha” which means “let’s drink tea” is also used to reference how Dim Sum was traditionally accompanied with tea when it was invented in 19th century Guangzhou tearooms. Consuming Dim Sum is a very social occasion with many people ordering and sharing multiple dishes together at one table. This is why Dim Sum is such an exciting dish to enjoy!
            Dim sum developed in the 19th-century tea houses of China’s Guangdong province. This southern coastal province was frequented by silk road traders who would often stop for refreshments and rest on their travels. Tea was said to promote good digestion so tea houses started to serve small bite-size snacks to give the traders strength for their trips. Ever since tea and Dim Sum have been served together giving way to the phrase “yum cha” or “to drink tea”. 
            The history of Dim Sum in Malaysia is deeply rooted in a time when the country’s own food culture was being established. From the 17th century onwards, the migration of southern Chinese citizens from Fujian, Canton and Guangdong brought new techniques and approaches which eventually combined with traditional Malay cooking forming what we know as Nyonya.  Dim sum was among many of the Canton (now Guangzhou) traditions that were adopted by the local populace.
            One of the classic dishes is Siumai. It is a steamed dumpling Dim Sum consisting of a prawn and minced pork filling that poke out of a chewy pastry wrapper. The top is then garnished with finely chopped carrots giving Shumai their signature appearance. Shumai is often encased within an egg-based wonton wrapper which is thicker and chewier than rice flour dough. At PA Food we’ve created a line of fresh mouth-watering Shumai products including seafood, mushroom chicken, black pepper chicken and original chicken.

        <p>Putu Perak’s origins trace back to the early 20th century, born from the ingenuity of communities residing along Perak’s riverbanks. Rice, a staple crop, was transformed into a delightful treat using simple bamboo steamers and locally sourced ingredients. The name itself is a delightful play on words – “Putu” meaning “cake” or “steamed”, and “Perak” denoting its state of origin. This unassuming steamed cake soon captivated hearts and stomachs, becoming a ubiquitous feature of night markets and family gatherings.
            The simplicity of Putu Perak lies in its ingredients. A blend of rice flour, grated coconut, and palm sugar is steamed to perfection, producing a soft, pillowy texture with a subtle sweetness. The filling, traditionally grated brown sugar and shredded coconut, adds a burst of contrasting textures and flavors. Each bite unfolds a symphony of textures – the yielding softness of the rice cake, the satisfying chew of the coconut, and the delightful crunch of the sugar, all harmonizing into a truly memorable experience.
            Putu Perak transcends mere culinary delight; it’s a window into the cultural tapestry of Perak. Its preparation, traditionally a communal affair, fostered social bonds and passed down generations-old techniques. The hiss of the steamer, the delicate folding of the rice batter, the skillful filling of the bamboo tubes – each step whispered tales of tradition and heritage. Putu Perak became a symbol of warmth, hospitality, and shared joy, gracing festive occasions and marking significant milestones in life.
            Today, Putu Perak’s legacy continues to evolve. While street vendors remain the custodians of the traditional experience, modern adaptations are emerging as a way to introduce this treat to the younger generations.

The origins of this popular rice dish can be traced back to the historical connections between Malaysians and South Indians, who migrated to Malaysia during the British colonial period.

        <p>Yong tau fu also spelled yong tao foo, yong tau fu, yong tau hu or yong tofu is a Hakka Chinese dish consisting primarily of tofu filled with ground meat mixture or fish paste. Variations on this dish feature - instead of tofu - vegetables and mushrooms stuffed with ground meat or fish paste. Yong tau foo is eaten in numerous ways, either dry with a sauce or served as a soup dish.
            It is commonly found in parts of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and in cities where there are large Hakka populations.
            Long ago, the Hakkas started migrating Southwards in order to flee the war in Northern China and through a series of migrations, finally settled Southern China. Because they couldn't get hold of wheat flour to make dumpling skins during the festivals, they started using tofu instead. The word “Nyong” in Hakka describes the action of filling the tofu with the stuffing and hence “Yong Tau Foo” was born
            Fried
            Traditional Hakka versions of yong tau foo consists of tofu cubes stuffed and heaped with minced meat (usually lamb or pork) and herbs, then fried until golden brown, or sometimes braised. Variations include usage of various condiments, including eggplants, shiitake mushrooms, and bitter melon stuffed with the same meat paste. Traditionally, yong tau foo is served in a clear yellow bean stew along with the bitter melon and shiitake variants. 
            Soup
            Particularly in the Southeast Asian Hakka diaspora, the term "yong tau foo" is used to describe a soup dish that substitutes minced meat with fish paste. The base of the dish is various forms of tofu stuffed with fish paste, but it is now common to stuff vegetables like bitter melon, okra, chilis with fish paste as well, and the soup can include other ingredients like fish balls, crab sticks, cuttlefish, sausages, etc. The foods are then sliced into bite-size pieces, cooked briefly in boiling broth and then served either in the broth as soup or with the broth in a separate bowl ("dry"). The dish is eaten with chopsticks and a soup spoon and can be eaten by itself or served with a bowl of steamed rice, noodles or rice vermicelli. Another variation of this dish would be to serve it with laksa gravy or curry sauce. Essential accompaniments are a spicy, vinegary chili sauce, originally made with red fermented bean curd and distantly similar in taste to Sriracha sauce, and a distinctive brown sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce for dipping.

The oysters, abundant off the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong, combined with the sweet potato starch (a carb substitute) and eggs, resulted in a dish that was both affordable and nutritious.

            When laborers from Fujian and Chaoshan migrated to British Malaya between the 1830s and 1930s, they brought along their culinary treasures, including Orh Chien.

The cheese melts nicely into the slightly watery gravy and the mix has just the right amount of creaminess. It isn’t too thick, so you won’t find the taste overwhelming after a few mouthfuls. The freshness and sweetness of the prawns are distinct. There’s even prawn roe scattered around the dish. True enough, Restoran Tong Sheng’s Cheesy Prawn Meehun is so well executed that we have zero complaints.</p>
